# Actor-Critic Algorithms for Risk-Sensitive MDPs
year: 2013 (nips), possibly could be way more advances in this field

## 1 Introduction

* std :  expected sum of discounted rewards and the average reward
* we would like to use a criterion that incorporates a penalty for the variability induced by a given policy
* This variability can be due to two types of uncertainties:
    *  1) uncertainties in the model parameters, which is the topic of robust MDPs (e.g., [12, 7, 24]), and
    * 2) the inherent uncertainty related to the stochastic nature of the system, which is the topic of **risk-sensitive MDPs**

risk-sensitive sequential decision-making
* objective : maximize a risk-sensitive criterion such as the expected exponential utility
* In this paper, we develop actor-critic algorithms for optimizing variance-related risk measures in both discounted and average reward MDPs
