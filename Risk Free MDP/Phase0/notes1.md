## pre_req : Example: Optimal Gambling
* At time t, the gambler may place a bet for any amount $A_t$ less than or equal to his current fortune $S_t$
* If he wins the bet (denoted by the event $W_t$ = 1) , lose = -1 
* eq: $$S_{t+1} = S_{t} + W_t. A_t$$
* W_t are indepdent RV
* The gambler’s utility is $log(S_T)$ , the logarithm of his final fortune
* Porblem: **Find the strategy that maximizes the gambler’s utility,**
