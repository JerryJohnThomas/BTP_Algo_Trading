* Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is commonly used to measure the historical volatility associated with an investment relative to its annual rate of return. 
* The Sharpe ratio measures investment performance by considering associated risks. 
* Beta is a measurement that compares the risk or volatility of an investment against the general market.
    * If a security's beta is equal to one, the security has exactly the same volatility profile as the broad market. A security with a beta greater than one means it is more volatile than the market. A security with a beta less than one means it is less volatile than the market.
    * For example, suppose a security's beta is 1.5. The security is considered 50% more volatile than the market. Beta is helpful when comparing across securitiesâ€”at a glance, beta easily identifies that an investment with a beta of 1.5 is more volatile than an investment with a beta of 1.3.
* One variation of the Sharpe ratio is the Sortino ratio which removes the effects of upward price movements on standard deviation to focus on the distribution of returns that are below the target or required return
* Value at Risk (VaR) - Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measurement used to assess the level of risk associated with a portfolio or company. 
    * For example, suppose a portfolio of investments has a one-year 10% VaR of $5 million. Therefore, the portfolio has a 10% chance of losing $5 million over a one-year period. 
* Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) - 
    * CVaR is most useful for investors wanting to know maximum potential losses for outcomes less statistically likely to occur.

Summary
* Beta is a measurement that compares the risk or volatility of an investment against the general market. Standard deviation measures the dispersion of performance from an investment's average. The Sharpe Ratio measures whether an investment's returns are fairly compensating an investor for the associate level of risk assumed.

Types of Risk
* Systematic risk is associated with the overall market.
*  unsystematic risk, is specifically associated with a company or sector, *solved by diversification*
