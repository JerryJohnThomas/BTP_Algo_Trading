* The usual optimization criteria for an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) are the expected sum of discounted rewards and the average reward.
* we may prefer to minimize some measure of risk as well as maximizing a usual optimization criterion. In such cases, we would like to use a criterion that incorporates a penalty for the variability induced by a given policy. This variability can be due to two types of uncertainties: 
	1) uncertainties in the model parameters, which is the topic of robust MDPs (e.g., [12, 7, 24]),
	2) the inherent uncertainty related to the stochastic nature of the system, which is the topic of risk-sensitive MDPs (e.g., [10]).

WHY IT SOMETIMES PAYS TO ACT CAUTIOUSLY 
* An obvious example is the field of finance where the main question is how to invest resources among various opportunities (e.g. assets like stocks, bonds, etc.) to achieve remarkable returns while simultaneously controlling the risk exposure of the investments
due to changing markets or economic conditions. Many traders try to achieve this by a
Markovitz-like portfolio management which distributes capital according to return and risk  
* estimates of the assets. A new approach using reinforcement learning techniques which
additionally integrates trading costs and other market imperfections has been proposed in
Neuneier, 1998. Here, these algorithms are naturally extended such that an explicit risk
control is now possible. The investor can decide how much risk shelhe is willing to accept
and then compute an optimal risk-averse investment strategy.

* Risk aversion is the tendency to avoid risk. 
* The term risk-averse describes the investor who chooses the preservation of capital over the potential for a higher-than-average return.
* 
* Risk averse can be contrasted with risk seeking.

Risk neutral
* The term risk-neutral describes the attitude of an individual who evaluates investment alternatives by focusing solely on potential gains regardless of the risk.


Pros and Cons of Being Risk Averse
Pros
	- Minimizes risk of losses
	- Can generate steady income
	- Guaranteed cash flows

Cons
	- Much lower expected returns, especially over time
	- Missed opportunities (opportunity cost)
	- Inflation erodes buying power of savings


Is It Good to Be Risk Averse?
Being risk averse is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you greatly lower your chances of losses, but you also can miss good opportunities and greater returns on riskier investments.


Risk-Seeking
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-seeking.asp

* Risk seekers are more interested in capital gains from speculative assets than capital preservation from lower-risk assets. 
* Risk tolerance is an important concept for investors and refers to the degree to which an investor is willing to accept risk for the potential of a higher return.
