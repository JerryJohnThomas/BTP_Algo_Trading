Title: A Guided Tour of Chapter 6 - Dynamic Asset-Allocation and Consumption
* actually slides are too good you need to go though them


## Introduction

* The two considerations are:
    1. How to allocate money across assets in one’s investment portfolio
    1. How much to consume for one’s needs/operations/pleasures
* Asset-Allocation and Consumption decisions at each time step
* Asset-Allocation decisions typically deal with Risk-Reward tradeoffs
* Consumption decisions are about spending now or later
* Objective: Horizon-Aggregated Expected Utility of Consumption
