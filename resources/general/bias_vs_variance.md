# Bias and variance.

## video 1 : krish naik

Bias is the expectation/difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

The errors are absolute (mean squared etc).Â 
Underfitting means for training and testing data accuracy is very low/ high bias and high variance.
Over fitting means training data accuracy is high test data accuracy is low. Low Bias and High Variance.
Variance: The variance of a model refers to the variability or spread of the model's predictions around their mean or expected value
It provides an indication of how sensitive the model is to changes in the training data. High Variance means highly sensitive.
